# Attack Entities
The basic method for attacking an entity is `bot.attack(entity)`

## Filtering
Using a filter helps you only attack mobs in a "Safe Distance" (*legit distance*) around the player, and by filtering by `Name` helps by targeting specific entities. If you don't add a filter your bot may attempt to attack `experience_orb`, `dropped_item`, and other entities.

You can filter multiple entities by using `['zombie', 'creeper'].includes(entity.name) &&...` in place of `entity.name === 'zombie'`

## Attack Zombie
Attack nearby zombies within 4.5 blocks
```js copy
let target = bot.nearestEntity(entity => entity.name === 'zombie' && entity.position.distanceTo(bot.entity.position) < 4.5);
if(!target) console.log('I cannot find a mob with this filter');
bot.attack(target)
```

## Attack Zombie, Skeleton, Creeper
Attack nearby zombies, skeletons, and creepers within 4.5 blocks
```js copy
let target = bot.nearestEntity(entity => ['zombie', 'skeleton', 'creeper'].includes(entity.name) && entity.position.distanceTo(bot.entity.position) < 4.5);
if(!target) console.log('I cannot find a mob with this filter');
bot.attack(target)
```
