# Placing Blocks

## Targeting Blocks
You can target blocks by using functions such as `bot.blockAtCursor()`, `bot.findBlock()`/`bot.findBlocks()`, `bot.blockAt(vec3)`, and other methods.

## referenceBlock and faceVector
`referenceBlock` is the block you want to place a new block against (next to, on top of, on bottom of)
`faceVector` is one of the six cardinal directions, such as `new Vec3(0, 1, 0)` for the top face, indicating which face of the referenceBlock to place the block against.

## Placing
```js copy
const vec3 = require('vec3');
let referenceBlock = bot.blockAtCursor();
let faceVectorTop = new vec3(0, 1, 0);
bot.placeBlock(referenceBlock, faceVectorTop);
```
