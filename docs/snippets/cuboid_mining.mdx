# Cuboid Mining

# Cuboid Class
I created a [tool](https://github.com/Pix3lPirat3/mineflayer-cuboid) for defining a cuboid to make it easier to define and interact with a cuboid region. You'll need to use [vec3](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/node-vec3) aswell.

# Installing
```bash copy
npm install mineflayer-cuboid
npm install node-vec3
```

# Defining
```js copy
const Cuboid = require('mineflayer-cuboid');
var v = require('vec3');
```

# Defining Cuboid
You'll need to define your cuboid, meaning the two corners `point1` and `point2`.
```js copy
let cube = new Cuboid(v(0, 0, 0), v(5, 5, 5));
```

# Cuboid Positions
You'll then use `getPositions()` to return an Array of block positions in your cube.
```js copy
let positions = cube.getPositions(); // [vec3]
```

# Position Looping
Then by looping through all the positions in the cube, we'll get the block at that position using `bot.blockAt(vec3)`, and dig it out. If it's an air block we can ignore it, so we use `continue` to skip to the next position.
```js copy
for(let a = 0; a < positions.length; a++) {
  let pos = positions[a];
  let block = bot.blockAt(pos);
  if(block.name === 'air') continue;
  await bot.dig(block);
}
```

# Pathfinding
If you're out of reach of blocks then you'll need to use the library [mineflayer-pathfinder](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer-pathfinder) to navigate to blocks.

```js copy
for(let a = 0; a < positions.length; a++) {
  let pos = positions[a];
  let block = bot.blockAt(pos);
  if(block.name === 'air') continue;
  await bot.pathfinder.goto(new GoalLookAtBlock(pos, bot.world, { reach: 4.5 }))
  await bot.dig(block);
}
```
