# Introduction

:::note[Notice]

This is **not** official documentation for any [PrismarineJS](https://prismarinejs.github.io/) project, and it shouldn't be treated that way. This is an attempt at a more beginner-friendly documentation/guide by [contributors](https://github.com/Pix3lPirat3/mineflayer-guide/graphs/contributors).

**Mineflayer** is a flexible, powerful, and easy to use library built on top of [node-minecraft-protocol](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/node-minecraft-protocol). It allows you to create Minecraft bots that can perform various tasks such as farming, mining, as well as basic to complex realistic player interactions.
